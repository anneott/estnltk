## Root directory for Vabamorf's lexicons

This directory contains Vabamorf's lexicons available in EstNLTK.  Each subdirectory should contain a pair of binary lexicons (`et.dct` and `et3.dct`). Subdirectory names must be ISO format dates, indicating dates in which corresponding lexicons were created or introduced into EstNLTK. By default, EstNLTK uses lexicons with the latest date.
